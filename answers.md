**what is foobar?**

- Foo" and "bar" as metasyntactic variables were popularised by MIT and DEC, the first references are in work on LISP and PDP-1 and Project MAC from 1964 onwards.


- Both "foo" and "bar" (and even "baz") were well known in popular culture, especially from Smokey Stover and Pogo comics, which will have been read by many TMRC members.

Also, it seems likely the military FUBAR contributed to their popularity.

**what is Database Sharding?**

Any application or website that sees significant growth will eventually need to scale in order to accommodate increases in traffic.

It can be difficult to predict how popular a website or application will become or how long it will maintain that popularity, which is why some **organizations choose a database architecture that allows them to scale their databases dynamically.**

Sharding is a database Architechture pattern related to <em>horizontal partitioning</em> --  **the practice of separating one table’s rows into multiple different tables, known as partitions.**

Each **partition has the same schema and columns**, but also **entirely different rows.** Likewise, the data held in each is unique and independent of the data held in other partitions.

**Sharding**

- Sharding involves breaking up one’s data into two or more smaller chunks, called **logical shards**.

- The logical shards are then distributed across separate database nodes, referred to as physical shards, which can hold **multiple logical shards**.

- Collection of theses **Logical shards**
